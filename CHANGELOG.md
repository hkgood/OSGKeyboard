# Changelog

All notable changes to OSGKeyboard will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

> **Note: v0.1.1 polish** — this is a small follow-up to v0.1.0 focused on review-driven cleanup
> (theme follow-up, ASR robustness, debug-print hygiene, docs). **No features are removed.**
> The iOS 26 `SpeechAnalyzer` path remains deferred to 0.2.0 (see below); v0.1.1 users continue
> to ship with the iOS 18 `SFSpeechRecognizer` path that shipped in v0.1.0. User experience is
> unchanged from v0.1.0.

### Fixed
- **Theme follows system appearance**: main App now renders a true light palette in light mode via `ThemedRoot` + `EnvironmentKey<ThemePalette>`. The keyboard extension deliberately stays dark (Apple's default) and now uses a transparent `.background(Color.clear)` so the system UI chrome shows through.
- **Speech Recognition permission requested on first press**: added `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` to both targets' `Info.plist` and an explicit `SFSpeechRecognizer.requestAuthorization` call inside `pressBegan()`. Without these the iOS 18 ASR path silently returned `.denied` and the user heard nothing.
- **ASRService emits a DEBUG warning when on-device recognition isn't supported**, so it's obvious during dev that the request fell back to cloud.
- **App Group fallback behaviour**:
  - In `DEBUG`, a missing App Group now `fatalError`s with a precise remediation message (was a soft print + `.standard` fallback, which desynced the keyboard extension from the main App).
  - In release, the fallback is preserved but logged via `NSLog`.
- **`KeyboardViewController.loadPersistedLocale` self-check** (DEBUG only) prints the active provider / baseURL / masked API key / mode / locale, so the keyboard extension's view of the App Group is visible in the device console.
- **`KeyboardViewController.handleFinalTranscript` typed-error routing**: `LLMError.noAPIKey` (401) and `LLMError.http(429)` now surface as red, explicit error messages instead of silently inserting the raw transcript. Network / timeout errors still fall back to the raw transcript + error badge (no data loss).
- **`PolishingService` timeout** raised from 12 s to 15 s to align with `LLMClient`'s URL request timeout. Previously the polisher would race the network call and discard a successful response that arrived in the 12–15 s window.
- **DEBUG `print` cleanup**: the four `🔥 [OSGKeyboardApp] …` instrumentation prints in `OSGKeyboardApp.init()` and root views are now wrapped in `#if DEBUG`.

### Added
- "Test connection" button in `APISettingsCard`: fires a single `polish("ping")` round-trip and surfaces success or the typed LLM error inline. Helps the user confirm the App Group + key are working without leaving the main App.
- 5 new unit tests in `OSGKeyboardTests`: App Group cross-process persistence, 401 / 429 / timeout / noAPIKey catch paths, and `mode = .off` short-circuit.

### Changed
- README + `README.zh.md`: replaced `<OWNER>` placeholder with `hkgood` and rephrased the iOS 26 `SpeechAnalyzer` line as "planned for the next release" (the iOS 18 `SFSpeechRecognizer` path remains the only working ASR for v0.1).

### Known limitations
- iOS 26 `SpeechAnalyzer` + `DictationTranscriber` on-device ASR is planned for **0.2.0** (moved out of Unreleased scope to keep the v0.1 release honest about what ships).
- The keyboard does not work in password fields (iOS limitation).
- Microphone requires "Allow Full Access" to be enabled in iOS Settings.
- Whisper.cpp / on-device LLM polish is intentionally out of scope for v1 (cloud-only).

## [0.2.0] - Planned

### Added
- iOS 26+ `SpeechAnalyzer` + `DictationTranscriber` on-device ASR (lower latency, more locales).
- Bilingual UI (中文 / English) driven by a real `Localizable.strings` table; will land alongside a Settings → Language picker.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- First public pre-release.
