## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Flow Live Activity**: Dynamic Island shows the OSGKeyboard brand mark during an active voice session (ActivityKit widget extension). / **Flow 灵动岛 Live Activity**：语音会话期间在灵动岛显示 OSGKeyboard 品牌标识（ActivityKit 小组件扩展）。
- **Xiaomi MiMo cloud provider**: preset for the cloud engine with `mimo-v2.5` polish via `api.xiaomimimo.com` (on-device ASR, same pipeline as other online providers). / **小米 MiMo 云端引擎**：云端引擎新增预设，经 `api.xiaomimimo.com` 使用 `mimo-v2.5` 润色（端侧 ASR，与其他在线服务相同管线）。
- **Flow session policy (A)**: on-demand session start from the keyboard; inactivity-based expiry (10m–24h, default 12h) reset after each utterance; handoff auto-starts recording. / **Flow 会话策略（A）**：键盘按需启动会话；无活动超时（10 分钟–24 小时，默认 12 小时）每句结束后重置；交接完成后自动开始录音。
- **Skip app switch (B+C)**: settings toggle (default on) plus cold-start overlay with swipe-back guidance and optional “Return to [App]” alert. / **跳过应用切换（B+C）**：设置开关（默认开）+ 冷启动极简页（右滑引导 + 可选「返回 [App]」弹窗）。
- **Host return whitelist (C+D)**: `HostAppURLRegistry` with 20 high-frequency host apps; `sourceApplication` capture on `startflow`. / **宿主回跳白名单（C+D）**：`HostAppURLRegistry` 覆盖 20 个高频宿主 App；`startflow` 时记录 `sourceApplication`。

### Changed
- **Keyboard language label**: `PrimaryLanguage` set to `mis` so Settings no longer shows a misleading “English” subtitle under OSGKeyboard. / **键盘语言标签**：`PrimaryLanguage` 设为 `mis`，系统设置中 OSGKeyboard 下不再显示误导性的「英文」副标题。
- **Flow ASR pipelining**: shorter first chunk (2.5s) and 5s follow-ups so short utterances start on-device recognition while still recording; session-level ASR warmup and format cache reuse; live partials mirrored to the keyboard transcript line. / **Flow ASR 流水线**：首块 2.5 秒、后续 5 秒，短句录音期间即开始端侧识别；会话级 ASR 预热与格式缓存复用；实时 partial 同步到键盘转写行。
- **Flow tail drain**: after mic stop, capture drains trailing PCM (silence-detected, capped) before finishing the ASR stream; host finalize awaits drain; short final chunks re-transcribed with prior overlap; stitcher safe fallback when overlap merge would drop content. / **Flow 尾音排空**：停止录音后先排空尾部 PCM（静音检测 + 上限）再结束 ASR 流；主 App finalize 等待排空；过短末块与上一块 overlap 合并重识别；拼接误删时回退为安全合并。

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Custom ASR language model**: on-device `SFCustomLanguageModelData` bias model (computer/IT terms + curated AI/tech brands) prepared via `CustomLanguageModelManager` and applied to `DictationTranscriber` for Chinese dictation; compiled LM/Vocab shared through the App Group. / **自定义语音识别语言模型**：端侧 `SFCustomLanguageModelData` 偏置模型（计算机术语 + 精选 AI/科技品牌词），通过 `CustomLanguageModelManager` 在设备上准备并挂载到 `DictationTranscriber` 用于中文听写；编译后的 LM/Vocab 经 App Group 共享。
- **Cursor navigation**: keyboard drag pad (`CursorDragPad` / `CursorNavigation`) for precise caret movement. / **光标导航**：键盘拖动手势区（`CursorDragPad` / `CursorNavigation`），精确移动光标。
- **Key sound feedback**: `KeyboardSoundFeedback` plays system key clicks on input. / **按键音反馈**：`KeyboardSoundFeedback` 在输入时播放系统按键音。
- **Personal dictionary tooling**: `DictionaryAliasGenerator` and `PersonalDictionaryEntrySheet` for managing custom terms and aliases. / **个人词库工具**：`DictionaryAliasGenerator` 与 `PersonalDictionaryEntrySheet`，用于管理自定义词条与别名。
- **Transcript post-processing**: `TranscriptPostProcessor` quality gate on the shared ASR path. / **转写后处理**：共享 ASR 链路上的 `TranscriptPostProcessor` 质量校验。

### Changed
- **Tab bar visibility**: `TabBarVisibility` centralizes show/hide handling; retired `PageHeaderRow` / `PageHeaderConfirmButton`. / **标签栏可见性**：`TabBarVisibility` 统一管理显隐；移除 `PageHeaderRow` / `PageHeaderConfirmButton`。

### Removed
- **DictionaryLearner**: replaced by the new dictionary tooling. / **DictionaryLearner**：由新的词库工具取代。

### Security
- **DeepSeek key handling**: move the hardcoded API key out of `PreconfiguredKeys.swift` into a gitignored `PreconfiguredKeys.local.swift` (seeded from `.example` by `generate-xcodeproj.sh`). / **DeepSeek 密钥处理**：将硬编码 API 密钥移出 `PreconfiguredKeys.swift`，改为 gitignore 的 `PreconfiguredKeys.local.swift`（由 `generate-xcodeproj.sh` 从 `.example` 生成）。

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **ASR polish pipeline**: global output contract (no new emojis, punctuation, structure at every intensity), `TranscriptPostProcessor` quality gate, ultra-short utterances skip LLM, removed Off polish tier (legacy `off` migrates to Medium), preceding-text context in keyboard polish path.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Home usage statistics**: new home-screen stats card showing cumulative dictation time, dictation characters, translation characters, and personal-dictionary entry count.

### Changed
- **Local engine polish path**: local mode now uses the built-in DeepSeek polish path by default, removing the separate "Cloud polish after ASR" toggle and user-facing DeepSeek API key setup.
- **Provider API keys**: cloud-provider API keys are isolated per provider in Keychain, so switching providers no longer reuses the previous vendor's key.
- **Translation availability**: translation settings are visible for both local and cloud engines.
- **DeepSeek provider visibility**: DeepSeek is reserved for the local engine's built-in path and is no longer shown as a cloud-provider picker option.

### Fixed
- **Home stats rendering**: the stats card gradient background now uses a View-backed background compatible with SwiftUI's type system.
- **Usage statistics imports**: the usage statistics store now imports the shared module required for translation-state checks.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Post-polish translation** for cloud and local engines: target-language picker in Settings / onboarding, `TranslationChip` on the keyboard top bar, and `PolishMode.translate` in `PolishingService`.
- **Preconfigured DeepSeek key** (`PreconfiguredKeys`) for local-engine cloud polish without round-tripping the Settings API card.

### Changed
- **Local-engine translation is gated on cloud polish**: the translation row and LLM step are hidden/disabled until "Cloud polish after ASR" is enabled; turning polish off clears a stale translation target.
- **Local-engine LLM endpoint pinning**: when the pipeline routes through DeepSeek, base URL and model come from the DeepSeek preset instead of the user's cloud-provider settings (fixes DeepSeek key + Qwen URL 401s).

### Fixed
- **Translation chip always visible** when the engine can run cloud LLM (cloud always; local when cloud polish is on) — no longer hidden when target is "不翻译".
- **Keyboard translation menu** first item shows "不翻译"; chip label when off stays "翻译".
- **Translation toggle race**: 2.5s protect window after chip writes, Darwin config notification, host finalize re-reads App Group; turning off cloud polish no longer clears saved translation target.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-24

### Removed
- **Qwen3 CoreML on-device ASR stack** (rolled back from v0.2.0). Deleted the vendored `Qwen3Speech` SPM package, the `Qwen3ASRService`, the `ModelManager` / `OnDeviceModelWarmup` / `OnDeviceModelsView` / `DownloadConfirmSheet` UI and downloaders, the `OnDeviceModel` and `OnDeviceModelStatus` shared models, and the corresponding `LocalASRBackend.qwen3ASR` enum case. Removed the `Qwen3ASRServiceProvider` registration in `OSGKeyboardApp`, the `ModelScope`/`HuggingFace` mirror picker, and the `Qwen3Speech` SPM package declaration from `project.yml`. No more model download / loading / warm-up code paths or UI state.

### Changed
- **Local engine narrows to iOS ASR**. The on-device engine is now exclusively iOS 26 `SpeechAnalyzer` + `DictationTranscriber` (with `SFSpeechRecognizer` as the pre-26 fallback). The previous `.qwen3ASR` backend has been removed; `LocalASRBackend` retains a single `.speechAnalyzer` case so the next non-iOS backend can slot in without touching every call site.
- **Local engine is genuinely local by default**. When the user picks "local" and leaves the new polish toggle off, the transcript is inserted at the cursor as-is — no cloud LLM round-trip.
- **DeepSeek preset defaults to `deepseek-v4-flash`**. The DeepSeek `LLMProvider.presets` entry's `defaultModel` was bumped from `deepseek-chat`; existing users keep their saved model name until they re-pick the preset.

### Added
- **Cloud polish toggle for the local engine**. Settings → On-device models → "Cloud polish after ASR". When enabled, the local-engine transcript is routed through the user's configured cloud LLM (DeepSeek by default) via the existing `PolishingService` + `LLMClient` chain. When disabled, the local engine is ASR-only. The toggle is a plain `Bool` (`ProviderConfig.localModeCloudPolishEnabled`) and persists in the App Group so the keyboard extension can honour it during live dictation.
- **DeepSeek API key path for the local polish flow**. SettingsView reveals the `providerSection` / `apiSection` cards when the polish toggle is on so the user can paste a DeepSeek key into the existing Keychain-bound field. `PolishingService` short-circuits with a new `PolishError.missingAPIKey` and surfaces a localised "fill in your DeepSeek key" warning when the toggle is on but the Keychain is empty. The raw transcript is still inserted (no data loss).
- **iOS 26 `SpeechAnalyzer` + `DictationTranscriber` is now the documented local ASR path**. The pre-v0.2.0 code already supported this; v0.2.1 makes it the default and only on-device backend and adds a "Built-in" badge on the local-engine card so users see there's nothing to download.

### Fixed
- **Two Swift 6 strict-concurrency issues** in `LiveDictationController` and `FlowSessionManager` (the weak `[weak self]` capture inside `await MainActor.run { }` blocks) that were blocking `xcodebuild` clean builds under `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY=complete`. The detached-task closure now re-captures the weak reference under `@MainActor` isolation.
- `OpenSourceLicensesView` no longer lists the deleted `speech-swift`, `swift-transformers`, `qwen3-asr-coreml`, or `qwen3-asr-upstream` entries; only `Google Material Icons` remains.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Local engine with on-device Qwen models**: Optional Qwen3-ASR 0.6B speech recognition and Qwen3.5-0.8B text polish, fully offline after download.
- **On-device model management**: Download, progress, delete, and readiness status in Settings; mirror auto-selection between ModelScope and Hugging Face with fallback.
- **Engine picker**: Choose between local (on-device ASR + polish) and cloud (ASR + user-configured LLM polish).
- **Flow session dictation**: TypeWhisper-style continuous capture in the host app with keyboard handoff via App Group.
- **Open-source licenses** screen for bundled third-party components.

### Changed
- **Settings simplified**: Merged language and model sections; cloud mode always enables polish (removed off/transcribe mode picker).
- **Keyboard UI**: Local/cloud engine badges replace the mode menu; shows model-not-downloaded guidance when the local stack is incomplete.
- **iPhone only**: Set `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` to `"1"` for both targets; portrait-only orientations.
- **Keyboard preview always dark**: Preview injects the dark palette regardless of app theme.
- **Docs consistency**: README/README.zh aligned to the iOS 26+ capability set.

### Fixed
- **ModelScope download progress**: Progress now tracks byte counts instead of jumping to 50% after the first file.
- **Light/Dark mode consistency** for shared button/card modifiers via `@Environment(\.themePalette)`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Light/Dark mode consistency**: `cardSurface()`, `primaryButton()`, `secondaryButton()`, and `pillChip()` view modifiers in `Theme.swift` now use `ViewModifier` structs that read from `@Environment(\.themePalette)`. Previously they used hardcoded dark `Palette` constants, causing cards and buttons to always render in dark mode even when the main App was in light mode.
- **TestFlight error 90474** (Invalid bundle): Added `UIRequiresFullScreen: true` and all four `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` values to `Info.plist` via `project.yml`. The app targets iPhone + iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1,2"`), and Apple requires all four orientations for iPad multitasking; setting `UIRequiresFullScreen` opts out of slide-over/split-view while still satisfying the validator.
- **Keyboard Preview cycling**: The "Tap the disc to cycle states" prompt now actually works. `KeyboardPreviewStub` gained an `onTap` closure wired to `cyclePhase()` in `KeyboardPreviewSheet`, which rotates `.idle → .recording → .processing → .idle` with animation. Sample transcript text is shown during the `.recording` phase.

### Added
- **Dynamic ASR locale picker**: Settings now loads the full list of supported locales from `SFSpeechRecognizer.supportedLocales()` on appear (off the main thread). Each locale shows an on-device badge (iPhone icon) when the device supports on-device recognition for that language — giving users confidence about which locales avoid sending audio to the cloud. A static fallback list is shown while the async load is in progress.
- `Speech.framework` linked to the main App target in `project.yml` (needed by the new dynamic locale loader in `SettingsView`).

### Changed
- `pillChip(foreground:)` signature changed from `foreground: Color = Palette.textSecondary` to `foreground: Color? = nil`; callers that pass an explicit color are unaffected.

> **Note: v0.1.1 polish** — this is a small follow-up to v0.1.0 focused on review-driven cleanup
> (theme follow-up, ASR robustness, debug-print hygiene, docs). **No features are removed.**
### Fixed
- **PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy audited for honesty**: removed the three undeclared `NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType` entries (`FileTimestamp` / `DiskSpace` / `SystemBootTime`) the project doesn't actually use, and added `ActiveKeyboards` (reason `DDA9.1`) to the keyboard extension's manifest because `advanceToNextInputMode()` is in the tap path. The main App now declares only `UserDefaults` (reason `CA92.1`), which is the only Required Reason API it touches.
- **Theme follows system appearance**: main App now renders a true light palette in light mode via `ThemedRoot` + `EnvironmentKey<ThemePalette>`. The keyboard extension deliberately stays dark (Apple's default) and now uses a transparent `.background(Color.clear)` so the system UI chrome shows through.
- **Speech Recognition permission requested on first press**: added `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` to both targets' `Info.plist` and an explicit `SFSpeechRecognizer.requestAuthorization` call inside `pressBegan()`. Without these, speech authorization could remain `.denied` and recognition would fail silently.
- **ASRService emits a DEBUG warning when on-device recognition isn't supported**, so it's obvious during dev that the request fell back to cloud.
- **App Group fallback behaviour**:
  - In `DEBUG`, a missing App Group now `fatalError`s with a precise remediation message (was a soft print + `.standard` fallback, which desynced the keyboard extension from the main App).
  - In release, the fallback is preserved but logged via `NSLog`.
- **`KeyboardViewController.loadPersistedLocale` self-check** (DEBUG only) prints the active provider / baseURL / masked API key / mode / locale, so the keyboard extension's view of the App Group is visible in the device console.
- **`KeyboardViewController.handleFinalTranscript` typed-error routing**: `LLMError.noAPIKey` (401) and `LLMError.http(429)` now surface as red, explicit error messages instead of silently inserting the raw transcript. Network / timeout errors still fall back to the raw transcript + error badge (no data loss).
- **`PolishingService` timeout** raised from 12 s to 15 s to align with `LLMClient`'s URL request timeout. Previously the polisher would race the network call and discard a successful response that arrived in the 12–15 s window.
- **DEBUG `print` cleanup**: the four `🔥 [OSGKeyboardApp] …` instrumentation prints in `OSGKeyboardApp.init()` and root views are now wrapped in `#if DEBUG`.

### Added
- "Test connection" button in `APISettingsCard`: fires a single `polish("ping")` round-trip and surfaces success or the typed LLM error inline. Helps the user confirm the App Group + key are working without leaving the main App.
- 5 new unit tests in `OSGKeyboardTests`: App Group cross-process persistence, 401 / 429 / timeout / noAPIKey catch paths, and `mode = .off` short-circuit.

### Changed
- README + `README.zh.md`: replaced `<OWNER>` placeholder with `hkgood` and aligned capability statements to the implemented iOS 26 path.

### Known limitations
- The keyboard does not work in password fields (iOS limitation).
- Microphone requires "Allow Full Access" to be enabled in iOS Settings.
- Whisper.cpp / on-device LLM polish is intentionally out of scope for v1 (cloud-only).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- First public pre-release.
